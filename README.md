**Objective of the Game**
Collect coins while avoiding traffic. If the dog gets hit by a car, it will lose one of its *three lives*. If you collect 10 coins, you will win the game.

**Instructions**
Press SELECT to start the game

Use the UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT buttons to navigate the dog across the road

Collide the dog's snout with the bone while pressing button A to increase the dog's speed and slow down the traffic

If the dog has the bone, press button B when colliding the bone with a car to both a) stop the car and b) allow the dog to collide with it without causing any damage *while the dog has the bone*. If the dog were to collide with a different car while holding the bone (without holding button B), the dog will lose the bone and the once iddle car will resume driving and could harm the dog if there's a collision. If the dog simply drops the bone, cars that were paused will resume driving and can harm the dog if there's a collision.
